Update 2016-10-03 - The official SketchUp documentation is now updated and using a similar idea. Visit the official [SketchUp Ruby API Documentation](http://ruby.sketchup.com/).


This is a project to document the [SketchUp Ruby API](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/ "SketchUp Ruby API") using YARD the Ruby documentation tool.

Although the official SketchUp Ruby API documentation is very good, it does have some problems. 

Lack of navigation between classes was a major feature missing although that has been recently address to some extent. 

The other major problem is accuracy. Many method parameters and return values are omitted, others are just wrong. Many of the code examples are poor or incorrect. 



Contributions of code or otherwise are happily accepted. If you aren't into writing yard docs, you can still [file issues](https://github.com/jimfoltz/SketchUp-Ruby-API-Doc/issues "issues") to report problems or  discuss the documentation.

The generated documentation is available online at [RubyDoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/github/jimfoltz/SketchUp-Ruby-API-Doc/master/frames "RubyDoc.info page")
